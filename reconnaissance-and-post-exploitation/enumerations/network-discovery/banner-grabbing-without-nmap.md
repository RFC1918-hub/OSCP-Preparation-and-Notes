# Banner grabbing \(without nmap\)

If nmap didnâ€™t grab banners \(or is not installed\), you can do it with `/dev/tcp/ip/port` `/dev/udp/ip/port` or by using telnet.

## **/dev/tcp/ip/port or /dev/udp/ip/port**

```text
cat < /dev/tcp/192.168.30.253/22
SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_6.2p2 Debian-6
^C pressed here
```

For doing it with udp ports is the same, but changing tcp for udp

## **telnet**

```text
telnet 192.168.30.253 22
SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_6.2p2 Debian-6
^C pressed here
```
