# Remote Desktop Protocol

## RDP

### rdesktop

If we have access to a windows machine with a valid user/credentials and this user is in the “Remote Desktop Users”, we can share a local directorie as a mount volume through rdp itself once we connect to the machine:

```text
rdesktop -g 1600x800 -r disk:tmp=/usr/share/windows-binaries 192.168.30.30 -u pelota -p -
```

### xfreerdp

If we have access to a windows machine with a valid user/credentials and this user is in the “Remote Desktop Users”

```text
xfreerdp /u:joe /p:Pass123! /v:172.16.1.102
```

If we have access to a windows machine with a valid user/hash and this user is in the “Remote Desktop Users”

```text
xfreerdp /u:joe /pth:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee /v:172.16.1.102
```
