# File transfer over SMB

## smbserver.py

Starting the server.

```text
smbserver.py myshare /tmp/myshare -smb2
```

This will share the `/tmp/smbshare` directory over smb as `myshare`.

### For more convenience, this SMB share can be mounted directly on the windows as a drive:

Check currently mounted shares by running `net use`

Mount your `myshare` as drive `Z` \(or any other letter\) using the command `net use Z: \\<IP>\myshare`Now, you can simply change dir to `Z` and browse the shared files as a drive on the victim system.

The mount can be disconnected with command `net use Z: /d` and deleted with `net use Z: /delete` once you are done with it.
